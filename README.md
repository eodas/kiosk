The power of the IoT (Internet of Things) device increases greatly when business process (jBPM) can use them to provide information
about our real-world as well as execute IoT devices as part of our business process. The jBPM-BPMN modular allow us to define 
both the business processes and IoT devices behavior at the same time using one diagram. With Raspberry Pi IoT Tron adding Drools-jBPM to IoT,
we make the IoT devices "smart". Moving beyond just collecting IoT data and transitioning, to leveraging the new wealth of IoT data, 
to improving the SMART decision making is the key. The Executive Order Raspberry Pi IoT Tron AI-IoTBPMServer will help these IoT devices, environments, 
and products to self-monitor, self-diagnose and eventually, self-direct.

Raspberry Pi IoT Tron allows you to send IoT sensor data and information directly to the AI-IoTBPMServer Drools-jBPM Expert System from the aspberry Pi device.
This provides a very lite streamline IoT to Drools-jBPM (Business Process Management) application process with sensor and GPS positioning information.
